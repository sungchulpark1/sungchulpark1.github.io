      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born in Gwangju, South Korea and moved to Ontario, Canada at the age of 3, where I've lived ever since.
      </p>
      <p>My journey with computers began early. I was on a PC by age 3, playing <em>Diablo I</em> and <em>StarCraft
          I</em> by age 5. By 7, I was exploring StarCraft’s map editor, and by 9, I was diving into advanced scripting
        through <em>Warcraft III's</em> World Editor.</p>
      <p>At 12, I built and hosted a private MMORPG server that attracted over 150 daily active players for several
        months. That experience introduced me to networking, server management, and a passionate community.</p>
      <p>In my teens, I started using Game Maker to bring my own ideas to life. I collaborated with others on small game
        projects and by 16, I launched an online multiplayer game that reached 50+ daily players and fostered a
        tight-knit community.</p>
      <p>At 18, I pursued formal training in game development at Seneca College, studying game programming and design to
        sharpen my skills and turn my passion into a career.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve transitioned from game development to full stack web development, applying my programming
        skills to create engaging web applications. My background in game design has given me a unique perspective on
        user experience and interactivity, which I bring to every project I work on.</p>
      <p>Today, I’m a full stack developer with a focus on creating engaging and interactive web applications. My
        journey has been driven by a love for technology and a desire to connect with others through the games and
        applications I build.</p>
